problem statement:- Antimicrobial Stewardship Platform submitted by Amazon web services.

Discription:- Due to the pollution on the rise, food habits and hectic schedules we are getting 
              more and more prone to health-related issues for which many a times we use 
              antibiotics drugs. Antibiotic resistance on the riseâ€”and predicted to kill 10 million people per year by 
              2050. Do think of this problem in India context, lack of knowledge, how antibiotics 
              are prescribed, how to gather the usage of antibiotics across the country and how to 
              mitigate the challenge. Idea would be to see what all are the most common antibiotics / salt in those drugs 
              are being used, for what all diseases they are being prescribed for and predict what   
              are the probable antibiotic drugs ( salts ) which would become non-effective after a 
              certain time for curing a specific microbial infection or disease. Requirement is to 
              build an antimicrobial stewardship platform which should be able to provide this 
              solution.

Idea or Solution:-

                 Our web based application will be solution to bacterial retardation related issues. People will login to into the site and can search for any drugs and details(salts,diseases they are being prescribed for etc.) of it will be displayed.
In spite of just providing awareness of drugs used we are also providing a recommender system that uses Machine Learning Algorithms to get the next most preferred drugs that can be used in place of current drugs because current drug becomes non-effective after a certain time for curing a specific microbial infection or disease.
What We are doing:-
1. Create a interactive website to spread the knowledge of drugs and its contents and about causes of antibiotics retardation
2. Predict the possible time duration after which the drug for particular disease becomes ineffective.
3. Recommend the better drug than current one to use.
   
   
 Technology stack:-
     
                  HTML
                  Css
                  Bootstrap
                  Django
                  Python
                  Machine Learning
                  Database
                  
A interactive web based tool will help in solving Antibiotics resistence problem by slowing down bacterial retardation process. It uses the concept of prediction model by using the database from experts(doctors) in order to predict the next possible drug a person should take in place of those current drugs which becomes ineffective after some duration for som particular bacterial disease.
60-70% progress in this model we have achieved.
