Our web based application will be solution to bacterial retardation related issues. People will login to into the site and can search for any drugs and details(salts,diseases they are being prescribed for etc.) of it will be displayed.
It will be a prediction model for tuberculosis disease.Predict the possible time duration after which the drug for particular disease becomes ineffective.
It provides alternative drugs that will be efficient when the former drug does not treats the disease.
the first page that opens is the welcome page(index.html) that gives us the log in/sign up option. then it will lead to the login page.after logging in we see the home page(v1.html). the home page will have a search button(drug). search.html page will open.
the search option will give us the name of the drugs.the predict option will predict the alternative drugs.

In the 3rd milestone, we added all the discription of few drugs for TB which user can search for.
We also edited first and the second page.(added neon1.html and editted Index.html)
Backend patients data is also stored in Django admin.
Prediction page will accept data and store it in sqlite and that data is used for prediction of next probable drug that a patients should use when current drugs becomes ineffective.
Hence the overall solution will help to slow down Antibiotic resistence which is the required solution to given problem statement.
